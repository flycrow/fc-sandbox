Mask file
	https://nepp.nasa.gov/respace_mapld11/talks/thu/MAPLD_C/0825%20-%20Wang.pdf
	0 means check
	1 means ignore

	The mask file is generated
	  from three sources:
	• The MSD file that is generated by
	  BitGen (make sure the –m switch is
	  set)
	• A “Surgical Mask” file containing
	  locations of all the non-configuration
	  bits in the Virtex-5QV bitstream
	• An optional RBT header file if the
	  PROM device is a XQR17V
